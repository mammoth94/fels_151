      the: "The E-learning English multimedia source of news and information for millions of English learners worldwide."
      body: "Our E-Learning English programs are designed for beginning English learners by certified American English teachers. Our audio programs and captioned videos are written using vocabulary at the intermediate and upper-beginner level. The programs are read one-third slower than normal English speed. Online texts, MP3s and podcasts let people read, listen and learn American English and much more."
      end: "Some language teaching methods are dull and disconnected from real life. People soon forget what they learn, or focus on words and phrases without context. VOA Learning English maintains a loyal following among learners, teachers and educational publishers worldwide by using journalism to engage people's interests. Learners absorb American English through content drawn from world news, business, science, U.S. life, popular culture and other topics. People build their vocabulary, strengthen their speaking skills and improve their ability to communicate for work, school and everyday life."
